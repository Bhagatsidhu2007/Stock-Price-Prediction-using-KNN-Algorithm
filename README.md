# Stock-Price-Prediction-using-KNN-Algorithm
This project demonstrates use of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for predicting stock prices and classifying future stock movements (buy/sell signals) based on historical market data. It includes:

*Data collection using Yahoo Finance

*Feature engineering (Open-Close, High-Low)

*Classification for price direction

*Regression for close price prediction

*Model tuning using GridSearchCV

*Evaluation using accuracy and RMSE

This project serves as a foundation for applying machine learning in algorithmic trading and financial analysis.
